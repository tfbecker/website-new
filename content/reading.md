    review: "I watched the Netflix series first, and then I read the books. The second book is a drag at first but has such a crazy satisfying ending. I love the mixture of physics concepts with sci-fi, e.g., the Fermi Paradox."

    review: "This is one of the VC/accelerationist books. Nonetheless, it's a good read to understand how we drown ourselves in regulation. It speaks to my heart as a German."

    review: "lol everyone recommends this book and stupid me only read one chapter in uni. I recently re-read it and it is a masterpiece. I think all books that are written by people that do not want to write a book are exceptional."
