Back in 2023 I <a href="https://issuu.com/heartcore/docs/ai_report_final">wrote about productivity gains through AI</a> and since then not that much has happened. We dreamt big and I felt like there was this short time where we enjoyed an un-nerfed GPT-4 where people's imagination was sparked and we envisioned how the future of work could look like.

Since then only coding has really evolved. We've had multiple iterations of AI productivity startups:

1. **Wave I: RAG** → Gleam, Sana AI → <a href="https://www.nicolasbustamante.com/p/the-rag-obituary-killed-by-agents">RAG is dead</a> and they will get either bundled into Google Drive or acquired by enterprises (Sana AI was acquired by Workday)
2. **Better Interfaces**: Works for coding: Cursor and Lovable - but have not seen any product for the rest
    - I am using Claude Code on top of my knowledge management files in Obsidian - closest to what ChatGPT wants to become but has not reached and probably will never reach

The most interesting alley for me has always been hooking up agents with APIs. We have come a long way from Function/Tool calling, MCP servers (which are also dead), and now the last iteration of little recipes for agents to write helper scripts on the fly.

They are not new. When I spoke to Joans from <a href="https://beam.ai/">Beam</a> 1.5 years ago, they called these SOPs (standard operating procedures).

Anthropic calls them Skills and this is the most exciting thing I have seen in almost 2 years.

The obvious take for skills is:
- Ease of creation
- Versatility
- Context efficiency

The non-obvious:
- Iteration that is quick → even for non-technical people
- Build and teaching skills is democratized → Building an MCP server is actually hard
- Sharing this is great → actually an open research question → should we still use git or should people like Samuel from Lix or GitButler find a better way for version control

I think the hardest part is finding an easy-to-use setup like what Replit did for coding. Putting it into the hands of operational people in our company and letting them teach the agent. Anthropic is the most serious about this. OpenAI's ChatGPT and shareable gems are essentially useless without MCPs or APIs.
