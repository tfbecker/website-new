I often walk around and see names of companies that interest me. Mostly how big they are (revenue and earnings) and i hate going on Bundesanzeiger to find the information. So i made this bot to scrape the data for me.
The project is opensource and you can find the code [here](https://github.com/tfbecker/bundesanzeiger_telegram_bot).
